## Automating the Development Tasks (Bower & Grunt)

### Things I have learned that might help you

With a couple of projects completed, I thought this would be a good time to look into task automation and package management.

This article is for those who have limited knowledge of these tools. This is NOT a how-to, but more of a, this is a review with gotcha's and helpful hints and ideas.

My goal is to automate the new project install with Bower and then to follow it up with task management with Grunt.

#### Getting the Terminal App in Shape

If I am going to be using the terminal application a lot more, I wanted to get it updated with a few shortcuts and give it a facelift. To begin with, I installed Barry Clark's [BASHSTRAP](https://github.com/barryclark/bashstrap) along with the recommended [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/downloads). The process was very straight forward. The new commands are great, especially the 'z' directory tool!  Just make sure you 'cd' around a bit to build up the database.

#### Starting to Work & Learn Bower

Before I can automate any tasks I need to get a project setup.  That is where Bower comes in.



#### Installing and Configuring GruntJS

I will be following the [Getting Started with GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) and documenting interesting or gotcha's I find in the process.
